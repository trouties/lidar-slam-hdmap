"""End-to-end smoke integration test on real KITTI Seq 00 (first 200 frames).

Marked `slow` — opt-in via ``pytest -m slow``. Skipped automatically when
the KITTI dataset is not present at the configured path.

Why this exists: the rest of the test suite uses synthetic fixtures and
does not catch breakage at the boundaries between stages (e.g., a refactor
that changes pose array dtype, or an export that drops a feature class).
This test is the cheapest possible regression net for cross-stage contracts.
The 200-frame cap keeps wall time bounded; full-sequence runs belong in
``scripts/benchmark_stage5.py``.
